🏥 Hospital Management System – Case Study Description (From Your ER Diagram)

This Hospital Management System database is designed to manage all essential clinical and operational activities of a hospital by connecting multiple interrelated entities. 
The core of the system begins with PATIENT_INFO, which stores demographic, contact, medical insurance, and blood group details of each patient. 
Patients are linked to various healthcare activities through relational entities, ensuring smooth flow of information across the hospital.

Each patient has multiple ENCOUNTER_RECORDS, which capture every patient visit along with visit date, reasons, and the doctor involved. 
Doctors are stored in the DOCTOR_INFO entity, which records specialization, contact details, and personal information. 
An encounter may generate multiple PRESCRIPTIONS, where each prescription includes dosage, duration, instructions, and references a specific MEDICINE item. 
Medicines are stored in the MEDICINE entity with price, description, manufacturer, and medicine name.

The database also captures detailed clinical history through MEDICAL_HISTORY, which stores allergies, medications, and surgeries linked directly to each patient. 
Diagnostic workflows are handled through DIAGNOSTIC_TEST and ENCOUNTER_DIAGNOSTIC_TEST_RESULT, where each encounter may include several tests, their test dates, results, and comparison with normal ranges. 
Procedural workflows are managed by PROCEDURE_AND_SURGERIES and ENCOUNTER_PROCEDURES_RESULT, storing procedure type, department, created date, post-operative notes, and results for each performed procedure.

Overall, this ER diagram represents a fully functional hospital data model covering patient information, encounters, prescriptions, medicines, diagnostic tests, test results, procedures, and surgery outcomes. 
The combination of 1–1, 1–many, and many–many relationships provides a complete and accurate representation of real hospital operations, ensuring data consistency, traceability, 
and a strong foundation for building an actual Hospital Management System.
